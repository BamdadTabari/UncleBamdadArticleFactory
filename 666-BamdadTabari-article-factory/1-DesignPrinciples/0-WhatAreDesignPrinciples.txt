What Are Design Principles In Programming? 

Design principles in programming are a set of guidelines and best practices 
that help developers create well-structured, maintainable, and efficient software systems. 
These principles provide a foundation for writing code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend, 
ultimately leading to improved software quality and adaptability. 
By adhering to these principles, developers can create a well-structured codebase 
that is less prone to bugs and easier to refactor. 
These principles also make it easier for many people to collaborate on a project, simplify the process of extending, 
modifying, testing, and refactoring the code, and ultimately lead to improved software quality and adaptability.

Some key design principles include:

1. SOLID Principles: 
A set of five object-oriented design principles that focus on creating maintainable and scalable code. 
These principles include the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open-Closed Principle (OCP), 
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), 
and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): 
A principle that emphasizes avoiding code duplication to reduce maintenance complexity 
and potential inconsistencies.

3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): 
A principle that encourages simplicity in code and design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): 
A principle that advises developers to focus on delivering the features that are currently needed, 
rather than over-engineering or anticipating future requirements.

5. Composition Over Inheritance: 
A design principle that encourages the use of composition (combining simple objects to create more complex ones) 
instead of inheritance.

6. Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge): 
A principle that promotes reducing coupling between components by limiting the knowledge an object has about 
other objects in its own domain.
