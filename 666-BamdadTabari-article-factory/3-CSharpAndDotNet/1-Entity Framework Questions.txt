###Entity Framework Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------

What is Entity Framework Core and how does it differ from previous versions of Entity Framework?

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, open-source version of Entity Framework (EF) 
that was initially released as Entity Framework 7. 
It is designed to be more efficient, powerful, flexible, and extensible than previous versions of EF. 
EF Core is a complete rewrite of the original Entity Framework and is licensed under Apache License v2. 
It is designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and supports a new range of relational and NoSQL data stores.
EF Core is part of the .NET Core framework, which is cross-platform and open source, 
unlike the original Entity Framework, which was part of the .NET Framework, 
a proprietary Windows-only platform. 
EF Core is now in its sixth major version, EF Core 6.0, which was released on November 10, 2021.
EF Core is designed to support many scenarios not covered by the legacy EF6 stack and 
is generally much higher performing. 
The EF Core team is planning a comprehensive porting guide for applications moving from 
legacy EF6 to EF Core.
